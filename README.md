# OpenParkingMap

[OpenParkingMap](https://www.openparkingmap.com/)

This project was inspired by reading [The High Cost of Free Parking](https://www.amazon.com/High-Cost-Free-Parking-Updated/dp/193236496X), by Donald Shoup. From the description:

> Planners mandate free parking to alleviate congestion but end up distorting transportation choices, debasing urban design, damaging the economy, and degrading the environment. Ubiquitous free parking helps explain why our cities sprawl on a scale fit more for cars than for people, and why American motor vehicles now consume one-eighth of the world's total oil production. But it doesn't have to be this way.

[Here's](https://www.nytimes.com/2023/03/07/business/fewer-parking-spots.html) a good recent NYT article on the subject.
Also, check out the [Parking Reform Network](https://parkingreform.org/)!

This is a simple Nextjs app hosted on Vercel. I query the [OSM Overpass API](https://overpass-turbo.eu/) to get parking lot geometries.

Feel free to contribute to the project.
